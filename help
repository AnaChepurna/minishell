Hi! I am achepurn's minishell.

- just type a standart call to run any program in this computer;

- also I understand commands:
-- 'help' to show this massage;
-- 'env' to display environmental variables;
--  'setenv [variable name] [value]' to set environmental variable;
-- 'unsetenv [variable name]' to delete environmental variable;
-- 'undoenv [variable name]' to return previous value of varible;
-- 'resetenv' to reset environment to the state of beginning of this session;
-- 'cd [path]' to walk through the folders;
-- 'echo [flags] [values ...]' to print something on stdout;
---- -n - do not put '\n' in the end of output;
-- 'exit' to finish this session;

- use ';' to separate commands in your input;

- set variables to change your prompt:
-- GARLAND to mask of 'color:color:..' to change the heart color; I know such colors as red, blue, green, yellow, magenta, cyan and white; You can choose any number and order of colors;
-- PROMPT_PWD to 'on' to display your current pwd in your prompt;

- remember Cnrtl-C cannot break me;
